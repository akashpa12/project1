                            bed in the morning’. It’s the place where your needs, desires, ambitions, and satisfaction
                            meet. A place of balance. Small wonder that finding your ikigai is closely linked to living
                            longer. Finding your ikigai is easier than you might think. This book will help you work out
                            what your own ikigai really is, and equip you to change your life.
